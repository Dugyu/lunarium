# L.U.N.A Stage

**Stage** is the runtime rendering environment in **L.U.N.A.rium**.

It renders Lynx components in their actual execution context.
When embedded back into [**Studio**](../studio/README.md) via [**Lynx for Web**](https://lynxjs.org/guide/start/integrate-with-existing-apps.html#platform=web), Stage becomes the integrated performance space where authored components are previewed exactly as they will appear in reality.

## How to Explore

### Rspeedy project

This is a [ReactLynx](https://lynxjs.org/react/) project bootstrapped with [`create-rspeedy`](https://lynxjs.org/rspeedy/).

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Scan the QR code in the terminal with your **LynxExplorer App** to see the result.
