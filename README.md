# L.U.N.A.rium

The experimental realm of **Lynx UI New Aesthetics** - where tokens, variants, and anatomy shells take form before primitives land publicly.

**L.U.N.A.rium** is the theming laboratory of Lynx UI.

## Studio & Stage

Inside the **L.U.N.A** project, **Studio** and **Stage** form a dual orbit, authoring and rendering.

**Studio** is the creative workspace — a web app for composing, editing, and orchestrating Lynx components.

**Stage** is the live runtime — a Lynx app that renders components in their authentic execution environment.

The **Studio** carries an embedded **Stage** via Lynx for Web, so every adjustment is instantly reflected in true runtime light — bridging design intent with lived experience.
